        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
          As a member of this world, we should devote our efforts to help others
          in need.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The more you give, the greater you receive”, just like the meaning of
          this saying. We don’t have to do anything which exceeds our ability,
          but we can do our part by donating things which still work but useless
          for ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, let’s take action now, and also be comfortable to look for
          what you need. Used to be junior/senior high school students, so we
          highly understand the dilemma of students. Not to mention those in
          poor family, so we come up with this idea to set up a website for
          them. Through this website, they can know the immediate information of
          free resourse of books, food, and diverse events.

        <h3>Gathering</h3>
        <p>
          We hope that our program not only collect support goods, books, or
          food, but also gather enthusiastic people and do positive charity
          activities.

        <h3>Helping</h3>
        <p>
          Our purpose is to help students in need by variety ways because every
          student deserves to be treated well and grow up happily.

        <h3>Opening</h3>
        <p>
          Our program is open to anyone. Not only open for people who search for
          help, but also open for whoever want to devote themselves for charity.

        <h3>Sharing</h3>
        <p>
          As the saying goes, "Sharing is caring", we share the resources and
          love to those in need to show our concern. With efforts, people in
          need can have a better life and save resources.

        <h3>Teaching</h3>
        <p>
          For students, there are usually a lot of questions raising in their
          mind. We invite experts in each subject to give courses. With this
          idea, we can also help the students who don’t have surplus money to
          participate related course or events.
