          According to UNICEF, there will be an increase of 6 to 7 million
          children with malnutrition in 2020, and the increase of 14% is
          equivalent to more than 10,000 children who die prematurely every
          month.<br />
          And also about one-third of the world’s food produced is discarded
          every year, and Taiwan also loses nearly 3.73 million tons of food a
          year.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          In Taiwan not all families can have enough food and clothing. Many
          children from disadvantaged families are at the age when they need
          nourishment and are developing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And especially because of the epidemic, school has to be suspended and
          nutritional lunches must be interrupted, so they must endure
          starvation. We hope that through the service center around prople in
          need, they can still have normal meals and get nutritions.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The United Nations stated that it hopes that the world will achieve
          “zero hunger” by 2030. Therefore, we also hope to provide some help to
          the society. We hope that through corporate sponsorship and sharing
          methods, we can solve the problem of hunger and food waste for young
          people. Help the society.
