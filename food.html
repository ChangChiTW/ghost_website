        <p>
          According to UNICEF, there will be an increase of 6 to 7 million children with malnutrition in 2020, and the increase of 14% is equivalent to more than 10,000 children who die prematurely every month.<br>
          And also about one-third of the world’s food produced is discarded every year, and Taiwan also loses nearly 3.73 million tons of food a year.<br>
          In Taiwan not all families can have enough food and clothing. Many children from disadvantaged families are at the age when they need nourishment and are developing. Because of the epidemic, school has to be suspended and nutritional lunches must be interrupted, so they must endure starvation.<br>
          The United Nations stated that it hopes that the world will achieve “zero hunger” by 2030. Therefore, we also hope to provide some help to the society. We hope that through corporate sponsorship and sharing methods, we can solve the problem of hunger and food waste for young people. Help the society.
